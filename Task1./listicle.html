            Milo is a chocolate-flavoured malted powder product produced by Nestl√©, typically mixed with milk, hot water, or both, to produce a beverage. It was originally developed in Australia by Thomas Mayne in 1934.

Most commonly sold as a powder in a green can, often depicting various sporting activities, Milo is available as a premixed beverage in some countries and has been subsequently developed into a snack bar, breakfast cereal and protein granola. Its composition and taste differ from country to country.</p>
          <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Choclate</p>
